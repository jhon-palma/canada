				In Q4 2022, sales are down in all the categories across the board compared to Q4 2021. This is due to the hikes in interest rates, which has created a pullback in consumer confidence. Less buyers are jumping in, or have
				simply been priced out. There has been a price drop, which is exactly what the Bank of Canada was hoping for by increasing interest rates: to slow the market down a bit. This isn’t something to be alarmed by, in fact it

				indicative of how much a property is worth. Market value is based on supply and demand: how much is someone willing to pay for your property? To get the true market value of a property, a real estate broker is the

				RBC recently published an article titled “The beginning of the end for Canada’s housing market turndown”, giving us a breakdown of what is going on in the Canadian real estate market. This has been an interesting year for
				real estate, with the rise in interest rates, and the shifting from a seller’s to buyer’s market. While it has been slower, most of Canada, with the exception of Montreal, Ottawa, and Quebec City, is actually up in sales.

				When you’re visiting homes to buy there are a number of things you should be wary of saying in front of the seller or their broker. The property is where they’ve called home, and chances are there is an emotional attachment.
				Put on your best poker face and don’t give away your game, wether you love or hate it. If you come in hot with adoration or a bad attitude, all of that will get back to them unless you keep it between yourself and your

				This week we’re back with the Montreal metropolitan area Q3 update. The quarterly statistics have just been released and they show that sales are down significantly, due to the interest rate hikes. This did not contribute to
				the lowering of prices however, as the average price is up in every category. Particularly in the North and South shore, we are seeing big increases in the average median price across all types of properties. Because of the
				uncertainty that comes along with the interest rate hikes, I do suspect that the sales numbers in Q4 will continue to trend down, and it will be very interesting to see how the discussion about real estate will evolve. Do

				This week I’m going to be explaining a ban that will be coming into effect in Canada starting next year. The Canadian government has introduced a policy that will effectively ban foreign buyers from purchasing homes. As you
				know, the Canadian real estate market has been incredibly hot, and it has become increasingly harder to buy homes. This ban, coming into effect January 1, 2023, will block foreign buyers from buying homes to ensure that they
				remain accessible to Canadians. There are exemptions, but the government hopes that this will slow the market down enough to balance it out a bit more and ensure that Canadians can remain competitive players in their own

				This week I’m building off the video from last week, breaking down the buying process. We discussed mortgages, and today I’ll be clarifying what the mortgage insurance premium is. It is something you hear about often, but
				may not understand it fully. When you put anything less than 20% as a downpayment, the bank will require that an entity insures it. This acts as their security in case one were to default on the mortgage. There are multiple
				different insurers, notably CMHC which is a government entity that most people use. This premium does not affect your rate, it is essentially just an amount that is added to your mortgage. The premium works on a sliding
				scale: the more money you put down, the lower the premium. Follow along with the example, and if you have any questions let me know in the comments below! LJ Aguinaga CERTIFIED REAL ESTATE BROKER | LJ REALTIES

				This week I will be discussing what has been on everyone’s mind lately: prices in Montreal real estate. Because of the activity over the past couple of years, it is most people’s assumptions that something has to give and
				that prices can only go down. My opinion, based on recent data, is that they will continue to rise. There are a number of factors that contribute to this such as continuous lack of inventory on the market, and the influx of
				people coming into Montreal. In the last 15 years, the population has increased by 650,000. Because we still have more demand than supply, the price of home will continue to rise. With the interest rate hikes, people have
				lost some of their buying power so it could be an opportunity for you to go out and still get a property at a decent deal. If you need help as a buyer navigating the evolving market, reach out to us today! LJ Aguinaga

				This week I will be discussing a topic that is important to landlords and tenants alike: tenant insurance. It is prudent for tenants to take out an insurance policy to cover $2 million civil liability & their contents. This
				way should anything happen to the unit, such as flood or fire, insurance will cover the cost of them staying elsewhere and they will be protected financially. For the landlords, when your tenants have insurance it actually
				makes your own insurance policy cheaper. I have seen a situation with tenants who weren’t covered and it ended with them losing everything. Ever since then, I have made it a requirement for all my tenants to get insurance.
				That way we all have peace of mind knowing that all parties will be protected should anything happen. Do you require tenants to have insurance when they’re renting your properties? Let me know in the comments below! LJ

				This week I’ll be discussing a segment of the market that is currently on the rise: the rental market. With the recent increases in interest rates, some buyers are getting qualified at lower prices than they previously were.
				If they were looking at a $500,000 home last year, a $400,000 home that they are currently qualified for might not meet their standards and criteria. Some of these buyers are pivoting to rentals until the interest rates
				stabilize a little bit more. That being said, the demand for rentals is going to go up. The thing is, the supply of rentals has not increased. This is a time for landlords to stay on top of their rental increases and stay

				This week I’ll be discussing an article that was backed by RBC Research about a forecast on the Canadian housing market. It has been sending people into a bit of tailspin because it predicted a price decrease of 15%-20%.
				Now, I do not believe there is any reason to panic because this prediction is on a national level. The markets that really move real estate in Canada are the major ones, such as Vancouver and Toronto, and these are the
				markets that will feel a shift before Montreal does. We may see a correction of 5%-10% here, which may bring us back to January 2022 prices. When someone buys a property, I tell them to plan to stay there for at lease 5
				years to really be in the money. So even if there is a correction, things will bounce back over a couple of years and your investment will be fine. What are your thoughts on this forecast? Let me know in the comments below!

				invalid after that amount of time. Should you change anything on your property, such as building a deck or removing a pool, you would need to get a new certificate drawn up in this situation as well. But be sure to only do

				This week I will be discussing some good reasons to get a pre-sale inspection. When thinking of selling your property, it can be prudent to do an inspection prior to hitting the market. Understanding existing issues before
				entering negotiations gives you a lot more power in the transaction. You will have knowledge of the current state of your property and the opportunity to fix issues that may scare away a potential buyer. You will find out
				important things to note that you weren’t even aware were there. By having the property inspected and being aware of any potential problems, you can also give yourself more negotiating power. As a team, we always suggest
				strategies to protect you as a seller, and the pre-sale inspection does a great job of this. If you’re ready to list your property with some peace of mind, reach out to us today! LJ Aguinaga CERTIFIED REAL ESTATE BROKER | LJ

				This week I will be discussing something that has recently come into effect for real estate brokers and buyers alike: a mandatory brokerage contract to purchase. The BCP has always existed, but it is now a requirement set
				forth by our governing board. Previously, we had worked under a verbal contract that I, as an agent, would do my utmost to get the best deal for you as a buyer. Without a signed BCP, a broker could still write an offer for
				you but technically is not contractually obligated to guide you and go out of their way to get you the best price possible. By singing a BCP, you are ensuring that the broker you are working with will be able to go above and
				beyond for you. At LJ Realties, we have always prided ourselves on providing the best service to our buyers, and will continue to do so under the new BCP regulations. Reach out to us today! LJ Aguinaga CERTIFIED REAL ESTATE

				This quarter, the real estate market has definitely changed. We have shifted from a very strong seller’s market to a buyer’s market. Due to the rise in the interest rates, some buyers have become a little wary and have taken
				a step back, all while properties are still hitting the market. Now the the supply is outweighing the demand and properties are spending more days on market, buyers are presented with an opportunity: time and the ability to
				negotiate. We’ve been seeing less multiple-offer situations, the average number of days on market is rising, and buyers won’t miss out on a house if they happen to be away for a weekend. This is the time where listing
				brokers are going to focus on really selling a property, and doing all they can to make sure it gets the exposure it needs to sell. At LJ Realties, we have strong listing techniques and incredible marketing systems in place
				to ensure that our clients’ properties will sell, nom matter what the market situation is. Wether you are a buyer or a seller this quarter, reach out to us today! LJ Aguinaga CERTIFIED REAL ESTATE BROKER | LJ REALTIES

				This week I’ll be discussing a topic that is at the forefront of everyones mind and newsfeed: interest rates. There has been a significant increase, and it has been causing concern and leading people to believe that there
				will be a “crash”. I do not believe this will be the case. The increase will simply cause the market to shift, and that presents buyers with an opportunity. We will be seeing less of paying $100,000 over asking price for a
				property, you can see the property more than once, and there is now room for negotiation because there is less demand. The current 5 year fixed rate is at about 5% and you could probably get a variable interest rate of about
				3.2%. Because I believe that the interest rate will slowly go back down in the next 6-12 months, I would suggest going for a variable rate. We make sure to stay informed on the changes, so if you have any questions reach out
				to us today! LJ Aguinaga CERTIFIED REAL ESTATE BROKER | LJ REALTIES

				This week I will be talking about financial literacy. This term covers a broad spectrum of understanding your finances, but what I’d really like to focus on is how much you’re making versus how much you’re actually keeping.
				It’s great to say that you made a million dollars last year, but how much did you keep? A book that I like to reference is called “Profit First” and it really dives into the idea of paying yourself first by taking out your
				profits and working backwards from that to make sure you’re running a profitable business. What are your expenses compared to what you’re bringing in? What are you keeping after taxes? Are you working with a profit margin
				that is comfortable for you? These are important questions and the answers will bring you closer to financial literacy and eventually to financial freedom! LJ Aguinaga CERTIFIED REAL ESTATE BROKER | LJ REALTIES

				This week I’ll be discussing the way that you’re strategizing your investments. Markets, real estate or otherwise, can make some people uneasy. This causes some people to sit on the sidelines or play it too safe. When you’re
				young, you have your whole life ahead of you and that makes it the perfect time to take risks. With time on your side, you can easily recover from losses, and start compounding things to yield better results. I’ve seen many
				people sit on the sidelines of real estate, waiting for the perfect opportunity, and never making any moves. Then there are those that put in the work, took the risks early on, and are now enjoying their portfolios. When it

				This week I'm joined by Francesca Sgambetterra, and she's here to help you maximize your rental property. Presumably as a landlord, your goal is to have supplemental income by owning a rental property. One of the most
				important ways to ensure this happens is by keeping up with your yearly rental increases. Keeping your rents aligned with inflation and market value allows you to stay in the money, and makes it much easier to resell the
				building when the time comes. When it comes to calculating what you are allowed to increase the rent by, you can simply go to the Tribunal Administratif du Logement’s website for a calculator that takes your operating and
				any renovation expenses into account to calculate the increase. We have extensive property management experience so if you need help maximizing your rental property, reach out to us today! LJ Aguinaga CERTIFIED REAL ESTATE

				This week I’ll be discussing the different kind of taxation in real estate. One thing is certain: we will always be taxed. When you are purchasing a newly constructed property, you will be paying the PST and GST just like
				you would with a purchase in a store. Investment properties present different tax scenarios because they yield an income for you. And with any property you own, you will always pay municipal and school taxes to the city and

				This week I will be discussing the next book that we read in our LJ realties book club: Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki. This was another great read, especially for those who are looking to expand their financial
				literacy. Robert compares and contrasts two version of a father figure to illustrate important lessons and skills for success. There are a lot of really valuable takeaways and the main ones I’ve picked out are: use your
				knowledge in exchange for money instead your time, surround yourself with the smartest people you can, and not to avoid risks. Another key point that is discussed is our mentality. People with a negative mentality will not
				make it far and give you reasons not to do something. Learn to tune that out and invest in yourself so that you can always be levelling up. Did any of Robert’s lessons resonate with you? Let me know in the comments below! LJ

				will schedule visits, draft offers, and be there with you every step of the way through negotiations and realizing conditions of the sale. It’s important to work with a broker who you trust to properly represent your best
				interests when purchasing a home. We have a roster of experienced brokers who are ready to help you. Reach out for a buyer’s consultation today! LJ Aguinaga CERTIFIED REAL ESTATE BROKER | LJ REALTIES

				This week I’ll be discussing a very important document when it comes to purchasing real estate: the pre-approval. This is a document that you obtain from a bank that proves your capacity as a buyer by presenting what your
				debt capacity is. In the current market, it is very difficult to have you offer considered if you don’t submit your pre-approval along with it. Depending on wether you are an employee or self-employed, they will asses
				different information such as your earnings, your notice of assessments, recent pay stubs, your credit history, and any other pertinent information on what makes you a good candidate for a loan. The pre-approval should be
				your first step when preparing to buy a property. If you’re ready to start the process of purchasing real estate, reach out to us today and we can put you in touch with the right people to get pre-approved! LJ Aguinaga

				Three Types of Real Estate Markets This week I’ll be discussing the three different types of real estate markets that we experience. There’s a seller’s market, a buyer’s market, and a balanced market. A seller’s market is
				when the demand for properties is much higher than the inventory on the market, creating huge competition for the few properties available. The opposite is true for a buyer’s market. There are ample properties available for
				fewer buyers and there is a low probability that you will be bidding against others. Sellers and buyers have enormous power in their respective markets. When we experience a balanced market, the playing field is evened out
				and no one is at a particular advantage or disadvantage. We have been experiencing a very strong seller’s market and while I do expect it to continue for another year or two, rising interest rates will eventually balance it
				out. It may seem daunting to be a buyer right now, but it’s not impossible. We are successfully helping people find the right properties and we can help you too! Reach out to us today! LJ Aguinaga CERTIFIED REAL ESTATE

				This week I’ll be discussing interest rates: fixed versus variable. What’s the difference? What are the advantages to one over the other? A fixed interest rate is exactly how it sounds: it is a rate that will not change
				throughout the term of your mortgage. Whereas a variable rate is based off the prime rate of Canada, and the banks will give you a discount. Rates are ever changing, and I do predict they will be rising within the next
				months. Important note: went this video was filmed, the prime rate was at 2.45% and on Wednesday of this week the Bank of Canada raised it to 2.7%. Things changes fast and it can be hard to keep track of or even understand
				at times, but we are always keeping track of these changes in the rates and keeping our clients up to date. If you have any questions, reach out to us today! LJ Aguinaga CERTIFIED REAL ESTATE BROKER | LJ REALTIES

				This week I’ll be explaining what makes a good real estate investment. What makes something a good or bad investment all comes down to price. This particular case that I’m examining involves a condo that seemed like not such
				a great investment; there were issues, it wasn’t as nice as some of the other ones in the area, there was a tenant who might leave. When it comes to real estate, the first thing we have to think is: will we be in the money
				or not? The price of the condo versus other nicer and renovated condos in the are gave the buyer a buffer which they could use for their own renovations and improvements, and pull off a BRRRR. If you think you’re ready for
				the time commitment and effort, a property that requires some work can be a fantastic investment. We have had the opportunity to work with many investors, and we’re ready to help you too. Reach out to us today! LJ Aguinaga

				This week, I’m here to give you the market update for February 2022. January started off pretty slowly, as is the norm. Often people are still on vacation or recovering from the holidays, and not so focused on real estate.
				However, in the last few weeks things have really started to heat up. We’re seeing many multiple offer situations, and it’s still a tough time to be buyer. I foresee prices continuing to price by at least 15%. However, I
				don’t want buyers to be discouraged and let the fear of losing a bid keep them out of the game. We have proven time and time again that our methods and strategies work, and we see proof of it in every happy client we help

				This week Francesca Sgambetterra joins me to further our discussion on purchasing new construction. While one of the more fun steps is getting to choose the finishings and really tailor your space to your liking, there are
				other important steps to consider. As we did last week, we urge you to look into the developer and make sure that you’re working with someone reputable. You’re going to need to carefully examine the paperwork and financial
				aspect of your purchase, and understand the deposit and payments schemes. Crucially, you need to know the delays. It is very rare that a new construction is delivered right on time, so flexibility is key! We always recommend
				you have a real estate broker on your side to explain any of these points that you may not understand. So reach out to us today! Brokers like Francesca are here and ready to help you! LJ Aguinaga CERTIFIED REAL ESTATE BROKER

				This week I’m joined by David Leblanc to discuss a topic that he’s had firsthand experience with: purchasing property in a new construction development. His first two property purchases were new constructions and he has a
				lot of great insight to share. Buying in to a new construction project is great because, obviously, it will be brand new. However, it is important to understand that there will be delays, especially post-pandemic, and you
				need to plan for the event that your property might not be ready on the projected completion date. You also need to ensure that you are buying from a reputable developer that will delivery a quality property to fruition.
				Lastly, we would highly recommend that you have representation because the real estate broker selling you that property is not trying to help you get the best deal, they work for that project alone. If new construction is
				something that you’re interested, David is definitely a real estate broker that you want on your side. Reach out to us today! LJ Aguinaga CERTIFIED REAL ESTATE BROKER | LJ REALTIES

				This week David and I continue our discussion on the topic of real estate investing because it is important to us that our clients really understand the things that go on behind the scenes. As real estate brokers our job is
				to make the process of investing seem effortless and seamless to the clients. Behind every purchase should be weeks, if not months, of work that involve understanding exactly what the client’s goals are, providing detailed
				analysis of the financial breakdown, and gathering all of the pertinent information about the property before we even schedule a visit. Our goal is to ensure that investors find a property that is aligned with their goals
				and that they get the most that they can financially out of it. We firmly believe in being there for our clients every step of the way, but most people don’t know that we’ve already done most of the legwork for them before

				Happy new year and welcome back! I’d like to start off this year’s videos with my expectations of what will be going on in the real estate market for 2022. As in the last two years, I believe that it will remain in a
				seller’s market for the time being and prices and interest rates will continue to rise. As we progress through the pandemic, people may start to focus back on city living which will stabilize the cottage country market in
				the process. As we all had to adapt at being very digital in 2020, real estate brokers are going to have to up their marketing game. Properties are spending more time on the market, and sellers will want to work with a

				This week, I am joined again by Nikita Mukhanov and he's going to share his 5 tips to help buyers put their best offer forward when the time comes. I've said it before: we are currently experiencing a heavy seller's market,
				so buyers are having a tougher time than usual landing their dream home. But it's so important not to get discouraged or to give up. Nikita has had a lot of success with buyers this year and he's sharing some ideas of things
				you can do things to prepare for your purchase. Get your pre-approval from the bank to show sellers your buying power. When it comes time to submitting the offer, you can create a personalized letter telling the seller about

				This week I want to talk about why your home might not be selling in what is a very hot market at the moment. There are a number of factors to consider when you find your property has been sitting on the market for a while
				with no action. Ineffective marketing will reach less people and diminish traffic on your property. Low-quality photos of a messy home won’t attract buyers either. The most important aspect of all is to price the property
				properly. An overpriced home won’t sell just because the market is hot. If you’re looking to sell your home, a great first step is to have it evaluated, which we are fully capable of doing. Reach out to us today for your
				free evaluation! LJ Aguinaga CERTIFIED REAL ESTATE BROKER | LJ REALTIES

				A few weeks ago, I discussed the BRRRR Method which we use in real estate investments to optimize the property. To refresh your memory, the steps are: Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, and Repeat. Each of these steps are
				important manoeuvres to creating serious value in your real estate investments. Today I wanted to dive in deeper into each of those steps along with some real-life examples. While the method technically ends on the Refinance

				This week I’m here with fellow broker and teammate Nikita Mukhanov to discuss what kind of effects the pandemic had on the Montreal real estate market. Even if you weren’t selling or buying in 2020, you might have heard
				about the craziness that ensued. With so many shifts in lifestyles, there was a huge demand for homes and not enough supply to satisfy. Paired with the fact that interest rates were so low, this lead to the over-heating of
				the market. We saw a slight dip at the end of the summer, and then another rise to date. Although unpredictable changes can be intimidating, our team is ready to serve you to the best of our abilities. We not only survived

				This week I’ll be discussing different ways to organize your money in order to set yourself up for success. It involves putting an emphasis on different strategies, such as budgeting. While no one really enjoys it, budgeting
				is the absolutely necessary first step. Having multiple bank accounts assigned to different aspects of your budget will help you to stay organized and on top of different payments you will have to make. Most banks allow you
				to make transfers free of charge between accounts, so you can move the money around as needed. Reckless spending can be avoided when all that’s in the assigned bank account is what you have to work with. What are some of

				This week I will be discussing the inspection report. Following an inspection on a home, we receive the report from the inspector which we use to make decisions at that phase of a real estate transaction. It’s important to
				remember that inspectors write the report based on what they saw that day, and it’s their job to best represent the current state of the property. To the uninformed eye, a report may appear alarming and even aggressive,
				which is why we recommend that buyers be present for the inspection. The inspector may have said on the day that the problem should be addressed in a couple of years. If you only see it written on the report it could trigger
				a reaction that situation doesn’t warrant. So be there for the inspection, listen carefully, and trust your broker to be able to analyze and explain the report to you if and when you need the extra help. LJ Aguinaga

				This week I am discussing the three parts to a real estate return. When it comes to investment properties, most people may only think of the first two parts: appreciation and cash flow. But there is something else to
				consider: the capital pay-down. You will be receiving rent and paying down your mortgage, which is two-tiered, the capital and interest portions. Initially they will start off as roughly 50-50 amounts and as your mortgage
				gets paid off more and more, you will be paying down more of the capital portion than the interest portion. When considering how much money you could be making, it is important to consider which of the three parts is the
				most important to you, as every investor prioritizes differently. Which do you think is most important? I’d love to hear from you in the comments below. LJ Aguinaga CERTIFIED REAL ESTATE BROKER | LJ REALTIES

				This week I will be discussing accountability and it’s impact and importance in regards to your goals. The subject of accountability ties in to the previous videos about mentors and goal setting, so feel free to check those
				out as well. When it comes to our goals, the purpose of having a mentor or coach is to have someone there to make sure you show up and make sure that you achieve what you set out to do. Generally we are more likely to
				perform when someone is there to put us in the hot seat by asking us about our progress, ultimately, holding us accountable. Accountability is something I believe in strongly, what are your thoughts? Comment below! LJ

				This week I will be talking about goal setting: what it is, why it’s so important, and what it can lead to. When asking yourself what’s important to you and what you want to accomplish, don’t think small. My first tip is:
				set large goals and don’t be afraid to think bigger. Even if you don’t quite achieve it, I believe that you will go a lot further than you initially thought was possible when reaching for that bigger goal. Secondly, make
				sure you are tracking your progress. When you are able to track your progression, you will be able to more clearly understand your results. You will gain and understanding of where you’re heading, how you want to get there,
				and who you need to get there. What’s your goal setting process? Comment below! LJ Aguinaga CERTIFIED REAL ESTATE BROKER | LJ REALTIES

				This week I will be discussing a questions I received from someone who flips homes for a living: what should you do if you fall in love with a home you’ve flipped? This person would flip a home, live in it for a year (to
				avoid capital gains tax) and sell it to create capital in order to move on to the next flip. Falling in love with the home and deciding not to sell it might mean you don’t have the capital to buy your next project. Two weeks
				ago, I discussed how to to find money for your real estate deals so let’s take a look at this options. You can refinance the home to get some money back from the bank, you can borrow from or partner with others to regain the

				This week I will be discussing mentors and the ways that mentorship has changed my life. Although I was doing well in real estate, having the guidance and assistance to implement functional systems and tangible goals is what
				really pushed me to the next level. It was through an organization and their program that I was able to meet some key people who had already done what I wanted to do, allowing me to meet my goals much faster. Mentorship can
				come from anywhere, you don’t necessarily have to subscribe to a program. A mentor can be anyone who is a few steps ahead of you in your field, be it business or life. Surround yourself with people always looking to move
				forward, and you will find yourself rising to meet them on their level. LJ Aguinaga CERTIFIED REAL ESTATE BROKER | LJ REALTIES

				This week I will be discussing the effects of being self-employment from an investment perspective. While being self-employed comes along with many different benefits, there are important things to consider. Most
				importantly, your standing with the bank will change. You’ll be viewed as more of a risk and may have a more difficult time getting a loan from a bank. When purchasing an investment property, my recommendation is to stay in
				your current job, if possible, to facilitate getting the loan from the bank to potentially take advantage of better terms. When it comes to financing as a self-employed investor, it is important to understand all the risks.

				This week I’ll be discussing another real estate investment optimization strategy: the BRRRR Method. I touched on it briefly a couple of weeks ago when discussing whether to hold or flip properties. The BRRRR stands for:
				Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, and Repeat. Each part of it represents an important step in optimizing an investment property in order to create value. The BRRRR is the strategy of Buying the right property, Rehabilitating or

				This week is part two of my Investment Series, and I will be discussing what is called the “Smith Manoeuvre”. This investment tactic allows you to take interest on your principle residence and make it tax deductible. Of
				course, there are conditions that must be respected, and it should only be used when you are creating a business or invest in property in order to create an investment income. While this allows you to tap into an equity
				source that most people have but haven’t really discovered, you have to be very careful. Be sure to actively track all your moves and paperwork to avoid any potential issues if you get audited. I would highly recommend
				consulting an accountant to be sure you are making the right moves. Be sure to follow us next week for more tips and tricks, and don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions! LJ Aguinaga CERTIFIED REAL ESTATE BROKER | LJ

				This week, I am starting something new: my Investment Series, where I will be discussing different real estate investment strategies that I’ve picked up and used, and want to share with you. Today’s topic is whether to buy
				and hold a property or to flip it. While there are advantages to both, it really depends on your situation and your plans for the future. A flip will bring a more substantial payout, but you’ll need to be more careful with
				your investment going in and ensure your calculations are correct in order to make your money. A buy-and-hold is a great way to add on to an already existing income and make a long-term play in the real estate market.

				This week I’ll be discussing an interesting question: what were to happen to my real estate investment if the market drops in the next couple of years? If you are planning on staying in your home, there is no real impact.
				However, if you were planning on selling or refinancing, you might find yourself slightly more constrained than you would be in the hot market we’re currently in. I believe that the prices will continue to steadily go up for
				the next couple of years and do not predict that there will be a severe correction. You should be staying in the money even if you’re selling in a cooler market. As a general rule, interest rates don’t spike heavily in
				Canada in order to protect the general population. While we will always see increases in interest rates, they will be slight and steady in order to achieve a more balanced market. If you have any questions or concerns, reach

				This week I’ll be discussing a very important topic: waiving conditions. In the current market, it has become increasingly competitive to get your offer accepted because of the lack of inventory. Some buyers opt to waive
				certain conditions when submitting their offer in order for it to be more appealing to the sellers. By waiving conditions, you are essentially surrendering your right to do proper due diligence on what is usually the biggest
				transaction of your life. While in some cases an inspection is not absolutely necessary, such as when a recent report already exists or it is a brand new property, I am rarely comfortable waiving it because by doing so you
				are not being a prudent buyer. It is more favourable to look for longer and put in the work to know everything you can about the property so you can be covered, should any issues arise in the future. If you’re a buyer and
				need help navigating when to waive conditions or not, reach out to us today! LJ Aguinaga CERTIFIED REAL ESTATE BROKER | LJ REALTIES

				Cette semaine, je vais discuter des différences entre l'achat d'un condo divise versus indivise. C'est un sujet assez particulier au Québec, et peu de gens comprennent bien les différences. Il faut d'abord comprendre de quoi

				devenez copropriétaire de l'ensemble de l'immeuble et vous êtes responsable de votre pourcentage. Il existe des différences dans le financement: le montant de la mise de fonds nécessaire et les institutions que vous pouvez

				Cette semaine, je vais vous parler d'un sujet intéressant appelé "Househacking". Le househacking est un terme utilisé lorsqu'une personne achète une propriété et sous-loue une ou deux chambres. Cela peut s'appliquer aux
				maisons, aux condos, et même aux places de stationnement. C'est une pratique utile parce que les loyers perçus de la sous-location peuvent être utilisés pour compenser les coûts liés à la propriété: hypothèque, taxes,
				assurance, et génère un flux de revenues pour la propriété où il n'y en aurait pas eu auparavant. Le househacking peut être appliqué à n'importe quel type de propriété: que vous louiez plusieurs pièces d'une maison ou la
				deuxième chambre d'un appartement. En créant un flux de revenus sur des parties du logement que vous n'utilisez peut-être pas, vous vous procurez les fonds nécessaires à l'achat du logement suivant et à la création de votre

				I’m here this week with the Montreal real estate statistics update for April 2021. This was another really hot month for the market, especially when compared to the stats of April 2020. Sales and prices are up for properties
				across the board on the island: Single-family homes by 39%, condos by 18%, and multiplexes by 14%. The increase in price that we’re seeing is due to the fact that there is so little inventory on there market, there are
				currently a lot of buyers, and interest rates are going down. If you’re worried that the market will be this way forever, don’t be! There is simply not enough supply to absorb the demand right now, which has led to the
				numbers that we are currently seeing. We can expect to see a second waive of buyers coming into the market soon. All foreign buyers are likely to heat the market up a bit more when the borders open up. This will likely
				happen in September, right in line with back to school for university students. So I predict the market may stay crazy for another year or two. If you need help navigating, don’t hesitate to reach out! LJ Aguinaga CERTIFIED

				This week I’ll be focusing on a question I mostly get from my real estate investor clients: should you invest in a property close to your own home? I think it’s important to live relatively close to your investment property
				to allow for access in case of any emergencies. That being said, it can be beneficial to keep your distance as well so you don’t have your tenants knocking on your door for issues that are not necessarily pressing and keep
				your boundaries in the landlord-to-tenant relationship. Another option is to hire a property manager and remove yourself entirely from the equation so that you don’t have to worry about how close or far you are. This
				particular option is a necessity for those investing in other cities. The important thing to consider when hiring a property manager is whether it fits into the scope of your investment and if it works with your investment
				projections. Feel free to reach out to us for help with any of your property management needs! We have the experience and are ready to help! LJ Aguinaga CERTIFIED REAL ESTATE BROKER | LJ REALTIES

				This week I will be talking about condo fees: what are they and why are they so important to factor in when considering a purchase? Condo fees typically cover anything from maintenance to insurance costs of a building. A
				portion of condo fees go into a contingency fund that covers unforeseen circumstances, such as repairing the roof or replacing the windows. Buyers can get excited when they come across a building with low condo fees, but
				beware that this could mean management planned poorly: they may have tried to keep costs low at the expense of not being properly prepared for unsuspected issues that may arise. Whether you’re an investor or an
				owner-occupant it is essential to look at the condo fees and ask the right questions: what is included in the fees and how much money is in the contingency fund? Will it be enough to cover extra costs that may come your way?
				Make sure you get the full picture! Reach out to us with any questions you may have! LJ Aguinaga CERTIFIED REAL ESTATE BROKER | LJ REALTIES

				This week I will be addressing the current market situation in cottage country. Because of COVID and stay-at-home orders, more and more people have turned their real estate interests towards cottage country to change up
				their surroundings. This increased demand in cottages has changed the game, creating multiple-offer and overbidding situations in a previously stable market. There’s less options in terms of inventory and price negotiation,
				but when things go back to normal and people flock back to the city the prices will once again shift. In this climate, it is important to understand what kind of investment you are making and what you want to get out of it.
				Consider something you will be willing to hold on to for a long time, stay strong on your price point to make sure you’re always in the money. Let us know about your experiences below! LJ Aguinaga CERTIFIED REAL ESTATE

				This week I have the Montreal real estate statistics update for March 2021. Compared to March 2020, everything is up. On the island of Montreal, single-family homes by 33%, condominiums by 5%, and multiplexes by 10%. The
				reason we’ve seen a smaller increase in condominiums can definitely be attributed to COVID compressing the downtown Montreal market. Travel restrictions are halting foreign investments, office buildings are still closed and
				more people are working from home. However, if we look at the Greater Montreal area condo sales are actually up 21% compared to March 2020. We will continue to update you when the Q1 statistics are released. Let us know your

				This week I’ll be talking about building your own home. In this strong seller’s market that we’ve been experiencing in Montreal. Some people are considering building their own home instead of getting caught up in
				multiple-offer situations or bidding wars. While this may seem like a good idea, there are many factors to take into consideration before committing to this process. Financing can be difficult to get if you are doing this
				for the first time and aren’t backed by reputable builders, contractors and architects. Another thing to consider is the size of the task and the time it will take to to get everything done: you might be looking at a wait of
				up to a year and a half before you have a home. While the current market can be frustrating for buyers, you can trust us with the process and our ability to guide you through it. Reach out to us today!

				This week I’ll be discussing the difference between purchasing two triplexes versus one sixplex. It would be normal to assume that the same amount of units equals the same amount benefits. However, my personal preference
				would be to keep everything under one roof - meaning any repairs or replacements would be taken care of in one building instead of two. When it comes to financing, generally a simplex will require commercial financing and
				looking at the potential revenue the property will be bringing in. This means more math, more calculations, etc. There are different pros and cons to either option, and it really depends on what you’re looking for. We have

				This week I’ll be talking about different ways you can maximize your rental revenue if you’re a landlord, or to offset your rental costs as a tenant. For landlords, if you’ve got a unit that includes a storage locker and a
				parking spot, you might want to consider renting them out separately to get a larger monthly rent than you would if you rent them out as one piece. With more Montrealers working from home than ever, some of you may find that
				you no longer need your cars. If your unit includes a parking spot that you are no longer using, consider the advantage of renting it out to a neighbor to help offset your own rental payments per month. Whatever your needs

				This week, I will be talking about the Pre-Approval. In the current Montreal real estate market, we’re seeing a lot of multi-offer situations and it’s becoming increasingly important to show how serious you are when
				submitting an offer. The first step in your search for a property should be to have your pre-approval in-hand. Rates are ever-changing and decreased a lot over the last year until the recent increases this month. This means
				that most people’s purchasing power has gone up or down depending when they last updated their pre-approval. In order to ensure that you remain a competitive player, speak to your mortgage specialist so you have an update in
				regards to what you can actually get for financing. This will ensure you know how much you can offer when bidding for your potential home. Reach out to us today in order to get started off on the right foot! LJ Aguinaga

				In this weeks video, I tell the story of how our Christmas baskets came to be! LJ Realties usually hosts a big dinner party for all of our clients who purchased or sold properties with us throughout the year. That was not in
				the cards this year with the ongoing restrictions. The team quickly pivoted and put together beautiful holiday baskets with products from only local Montreal companies. We encourage all of our viewers to support local in an
				effort to help out. Comment below your favourite product featured in the basket!

				This week I discuss multiple offer situations and how to tackle them. The Montreal real estate market has been very busy and this has led to several multiple offer situations. Everyone has an opinion on how to tackle this,
				and today I share mine. I believe in having the first mover advantage. It’s always best to be the first offer in. By doing this we get the ball rolling and find out how many other bidders are willing to get into a multiple
				offer situation. More times than not, people who submit an offer knowing that there is already an offer on the table are submitting strong offers. The main reason I do this, is to avoid submitting a stronger than necessary
				offer simply because a low ball bidder submitted before us. When you submit first, most low-ballers decide to wait and see what will happen with the offer before submitting. Thank you for watching, comment your favorite
				strategy below.

				This week I discuss some of the factors we have to consider when buying a property in the winter months due to our Canadian winters. When purchasing a property in Montreal, QC during the winter months it's important to
				consider what we can't see due to several factors. After snowfalls a lot of the elements of a home are covered, roof, foundation, parging, etc. After 4pm we no longer have natural light for most of the winter. These factors
				play a large role in how we see a home and ultimately how we decide to proceed. Whenever possible, I recommend seeing a home in daylight to get the best possible look. Comment below if you've had to offer on a home after
				only 1 visit in the dark?

				In this weeks video I explain House Hacking. House hacking is the easiest way to live for free or almost free. I explain how it works and the benefits that come from it. Like anything in life, there’s no free lunch. It comes
				with its own sacrifices, but if you’re looking to get closer to financial freedom I highly recommend it. I have a few friends that have used this technique to acquire over 10 properties, and they’re continuing to grow their
				portfolio. It is the best way to start growing your portfolio when you’re young and don’t have dependants living with you. Let me know below if you would consider house hacking!?

				This week I discuss cottage country! With the pandemic there has been a huge spike in demand for cottages. These have been unprecedented times, and the Laurentian and Eastern townships have capitalized. Lots of residents of
				the Greater Montreal Area have opted to purchase their little piece of paradise. Like many of our clients, you may have considered purchasing one yourself! Buying a chalet is an awesome idea, but it’s important to note that
				there are several differences between cottages and homes in the city. In this video I outline some of the main differences to consider. Do you prefer the cottage life or city life?

				Je suis super excitée de relancer nos vidéos hebdomadaires sur l'immobilier! Cette semaine, je fais sommaire sur le marché. Cette année encore, le monde de l'immobilier reste chaud. La plupart des autres secteurs sont en
				pause, mais l'immobilier ne l'a pas été. Au cours des 12 derniers mois, tous les types de propriété ont augmenté de plus de 10 % dans la région du Grand Montréal, de plus de 11 % sur l'île de Montréal et d'un minimum de 14 %
				dans le sud-ouest de Montréal. Les principaux facteurs de cette hausse ont été les faibles taux d'intérêt et le fait que les acheteurs veulent plus d'espace. Avec la pandémie, les acheteurs ont eu le temps d'analyser leurs
				besoins réels et ont réorienté leurs dépenses dans ce sens. Comme toujours, cherchez à combler tous vos besoins en matière d'immobilier à Montréal. Laissez-nous un commentaire ci-dessous pour nous faire part de vos
				réflexions.
